- Task_01

  Given an array of numbers. Write a function to separate odd and even numbers in different arrays.

  [SEE Solution](./Task_1.js)

- Task_02

  Write a function that calculates sum, difference, multiplication and division between given array elements depending on passed operation symbol. Write appropriate function for each operation.

  [SEE Solution](./Task_2.js)

- Task_03

  Given a phone number. Write a function to clean it up, so it is valid. The rules are as follows:

  [SEE Solution](./Task_3.js)

- Task_04

  Given a word and a list of possible anagrams, select the correct sublist.

  [SEE Solution](./Task_4.js)

- Task_05

  Write a function, which receives a string, finds possible largest numbers in the string and returns their sum.

  [SEE Solution](./Task_5.js)

- Task_06

  Write a function which receives two strings and removes appearances of the second string from the first one.

  [SEE Solution](./Task_6.js)

- Task_07

  Write a function to compute a new string from the given one by moving the first char to come after the next two chars, so "abc" yields "bca". Repeat this process for each subsequent group of 3 chars. Ignore any group of fewer than 3 chars at the end.

  [SEE Solution](./Task_7.js)

- Task_08

  Write a function that accepts a string(a sentence) as a parameter and finds the longest word within the string. If there are several words which are the longest ones, print the last word(words can be separated by space, comma or hyphen).

  [SEE Solution](./Task_8.js)

- Task_09

  Write a function which receives an array and a number as arguments and returns a new array from the elements of the given array which are larger than the given number.

  [SEE Solution](./Task_9.js)

- Task_10

  [SEE Solution](./Task_10.js)

- Task_11

  Write a function, which receives two numbers as arguments and finds all numbers between them such that each digit of the number is even. The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

  [SEE Solution](./Task_11.js)
